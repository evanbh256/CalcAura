================================================================================
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
You are building "CalcAura," a private, invite-only website for a close-knit group 
of friends. The site tracks "Aura Points" (a social score). 

The goal is to create a mobile-responsive web application where friends can 
"Report" each other for doing embarrassing things (losing points) or cool things 
(gaining points). The group votes on these reports. The system prioritizes speed 
and "Raw Democracy" (mob rule is allowed).

================================================================================
2. CORE CONCEPTS & DATA NEEDS
================================================================================
The application needs to store and manage the following data concepts:

A. USERS (PROFILES)
   - Every user has a Username, an Avatar (image), and a Current Aura Score.
   - Everyone starts with 1000 Aura Points.
   - The system must differentiate between a standard user and an Admin (for 
     maintenance purposes).

B. INCIDENTS (THE REPORTS)
   - A report consists of:
     1. The Reporter (User A)
     2. The Offender (User B)
     3. A Description of what happened (e.g., "Tripped on stairs")
     4. The Amount of Aura to deduct or add.
     5. Optional: Evidence (a link to an image or upload).
     6. Status: Is it Pending, Disputed, Approved, or Rejected?
     7. Timestamps: When it was created and when it expires.

C. VOTES
   - The system must track which user voted on which incident.
   - A user can vote "Agree" or "Disagree."
   - The system must prevent a user from voting twice on the same report.

D. SEASONS (HISTORY)
   - The system needs to track who won previous months (Seasons) so the leaderboard 
     can be reset without losing history.

================================================================================
3. BUSINESS LOGIC & RULES
================================================================================

RULE 1: THE SPAM COOLDOWN
- To prevent bullying or spam, a user cannot create a new report against the 
  SAME person within 1 hour of their previous report against that person.

RULE 2: VOTING MECHANICS (RAW DEMOCRACY)
- When a report is filed, it enters a "Pending" state.
- If more than 50% of the group votes "Agree" within 1 hour, the report is 
  automatically "Approved," and the points are deducted/added immediately.
- If anyone votes "Disagree" before it is approved, the status changes to 
  "Disputed."
- Once "Disputed," the voting window remains open for 24 hours.

RULE 3: THE JUDGE PROTOCOL (FAIL-SAFE)
- If a report is "Disputed" and the 24-hour window runs out without a resolution:
  1. The system must find the "Judge."
  2. The Judge is defined as the user with the HIGHEST Aura Score who is 
     NOT the Reporter and NOT the Offender.
  3. If the highest score user is involved, the system picks the second highest.
  4. This Judge gets a special button on their screen to decide the outcome 
     unilaterally.

RULE 4: SEASONS & RESETS
- On the 1st of every month, the application must automatically:
  1. Record the current winner (highest score).
  2. Reset everyone's score back to 1000.
  3. Clear the main feed for a fresh start.

================================================================================
4. UI/UX GUIDELINES
================================================================================
- Platform: Web Application (Must look good on mobile phone browsers).
- Design Style: "Brutalist" and High Contrast. Dark mode by default.
- Navigation: Simple bottom or top bar with:
  1. Feed (The list of active reports).
  2. Leaderboard (Who is winning).
  3. Profile (My stats).
  4. "Report" Button (Big, easy to access button to file a new case).
- Interactions: Voting should be instant. No complex forms.

================================================================================
5. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPER
================================================================================
1. Select a modern, efficient web technology stack suitable for this project.
2. Set up a database structure that supports the concepts listed above.
3. Implement an authentication system (simple login/signup).
4. Create the "Report" flow so users can file incidents quickly.
5. Create the "Feed" view where users can see and vote on reports.
6. Implement the "Judge" logic to handle tied or expired disputes.
7. Ensure the site is responsive and works like an app on mobile browsers.
